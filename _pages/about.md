Sui, Xinxin is a PhD candidate in the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering program at UT Austin. She has been named as a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) since 2022. She works with prof. Dev Niyogi and prof. Zong-Liang Yang in the extreme weather and urban sustainability ([TExUS](https://texuslab.org/)) lab. Her doctoral research focuses on analyzing the urban influences on rainfall using remote sensing data.

Prior to joining UT Austin, Sui served as a research assistant at Peking University, China (2020), and the National University of Singapore (2019). She earned her Master's and Undergraduate degrees from TU Delft, Netherlands, and Jilin University, China, respectively. Her research interests encompass urban climate, hydrology, remote sensing, and machine learning. 

In her leisure time, she enjoys traveling and checking out coffee shops. Recently, she started to teach her delightful orange cat, Ollie, to communicate with her using sound buttons. With notable success, Ollie now expertly reminds Sui to provide food and affection. Ollie's hard work and progress in speaking deserve a Ph.D. degree as a cat!
