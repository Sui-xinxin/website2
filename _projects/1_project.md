Urbanization is a global change underway that is affecting regional weather and climate extremes, which play an emergent role in accelerating the frequency of extreme weather events in cities. This project will map urban rainfall hotspots across the globe with statistical and data-driven causal analysis methods. Further, we will analyze the urban induced precipitation anomalies covering a wide range of geography and climatological conditions, which are dominated by different urban precipitation processes. This study will help to project extreme precipitation in city areas and benefit society and decision-makers to create a resilient urban environment in response to extreme weather under global warming.

The color of the base map shows that the average of urban precipitation anomalies in the IPCC subregion is positive or negative. Each dot on the base map indicates one city, and the size and color of the dot describe the size and precipitation anomaly extent of the city. The pie charts show the percentage of cities with positive and negative (more or less precipitation over urban grids) urban precipitation anomalies in each continent.
