## The influence of Low Impact Development (LID) on basin runoff in a half-urbanized catchment: A case study in San Antonio, Texas

Low Impact Development (LID) was promoted as an alternative to conventional urban drainage methods. The effects of LID at the site or urban scales have been widely evaluated. This project aims to investigate the impact of LID implementation on basin runoff at a regional scale in a half-urbanized catchment, particularly the overlap of urban and rural sub-flows at peak times. A SUPERFLEX conceptual model framework is adapted as a semi-distributed model to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship in the catchment for San Antonio, Texas, as a case study. Scenario analyses of both urban development and LID implementation are conducted. Results show that (1) the infill urban development strategy benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban development; (2) in non-flood season, permeable pavements, bioretention cells, and vegetated swales decrease peak runoff significantly, and permeable pavements, bioretention cells, and green roofs are good at runoff volume retention; (3) contrary to the general opinion about the peak reduction effect of LID, for a partly urbanized, partly rural basin, the LID implementation delays urban peaks and may cause larger stacking of rural and urban peak runoffs, leading to larger basin peaks under extremely wet conditions.

## Sponge City Multidisciplinary Project

The Sponge City Project consists of a multidisciplinary team of six MSc students from the disciplines of Hydraulic Engineering, Water Management, Architecture and Urbanism. In summer 2018, the Sponge City Project Team went to China to work on the implementation of the Sponge City programme, an initiative launched by the government of China to deal with urban flooding problems, due to changed in land use pattern and climate change. 

Based on a Research by Design approach, the team developed an integrated design system for the ErQi International Business District, in Wuhan. This meant the combination of analytical thinking, focused on the translation and the interpretation of data, and design thinking, with a focus on the development of new knowledge and spatial translation. Participating in this project presented the opportunity to work on an actual assignment together with the stakeholders such as the designers and developers, while still maintaining the academic freedom to formulate their own design in an interdisciplinary way.
